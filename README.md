# Parent Query Assistant

This project is an educational assistant designed to help answer common parent queries in a school or academic setting.  
It was inspired by an internship style prompt, but developed entirely on my own as a personal learning and portfolio project.

The goal is to demonstrate how natural language processing and semantic search can be used to handle real-world FAQ-style interactions in an educational context.
